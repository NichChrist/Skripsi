"Been on discord years, here lately it will not upload videos from my gallery. Gets to about 80% then goes slower than dial up. When gets to 90ish drops back to 80ish and repeats until fails. Literally 2 to 3 minute videos. 0 issues on the tiktok, snapchat, Facebook, band, and Instagram. ?????",1,2024-09-26,0
awesome sauce,5,2024-09-26,1
Loved this app for YEARS- got my first ad today and honestly I'm upset. Was really hoping this would be the one platform that wouldn't shell out like every other app so I could talk to my friends wothout being bombarded by endless companies selling something or some game and wanting my money. Disappointed but not surprised.,1,2024-09-26,0

"Newest updates broke video sharing. Lots of new bugs, like super zoomed in images if clicking a notification rather than the app itself. Tried reinstall, tried phone restart. No fixes. Since the responses seem to be automatically written, taking another star. If they read my review they can see that I tried their steps and it still isn't working.",2,2024-09-26,0

I had to uninstall the app because it stopped working. Not user friendly.,1,2024-09-26,0

"New messages only send and load if you haven't tabbed out since your last phone reboot. I miss when it worked reliably. All power / permissions settings are maxed out. I don't know if it's Discord's fault or android's, but it worked fine last year. Fantastic app aside from having to reboot my phone handfuls of times a day.",3,2024-09-26,0
This update is terrible lags out and can't even message button won't click too slow,1,2024-09-26,0
"Since the new update, sending videos is nearly impossible. The upload gets to the last quarter of completion, then keeps resetting itself over and over again until it eventually fails. This is ridiculous because I've never once had this problem before, now I can't share memes with friends at all. It's not poor connection, as before the update videos would send fine. In response to the dev: I'm not an idiot, restarting and reinstalling has already been done multiple times, obviously.",1,2024-09-26,0
"So the pass time that i have discord it was fun playing with my teams on vr and every 2 to 5 months.

"I just can't give this app the 5 stars it would've otherwise deserved. There is an insanely annoying bug, where when you try to tap on a video or an image, it will do this weird thing where it goes up and to the side, making the content unwatchable. If this glitch that happens 50% of the time I open the app was fixed, then I would glady rate it 5 stars. And another thing, when the glitch does happen and I have to reload the app, it's very slow to load as I use an older Samsung galaxy s7.",3,2024-09-26,0

"With every new update, the app is getting worse and worse. It's becoming unintuitive and unusable because of an extremely bad perfomance. You can't access half of features even such as emojis because the app shuts down everytime now. On top of that, the design of discord is horrendous, it's not a good design choice to make the message bar hard to use because of so many unnecessary buttons. Please listen to users.",1,2024-09-26,0

"The Discord app on mobile is absolutely repulsive. The keyboard glitches 3/4 of the times you click on it to write, it's exceedingly difficult to open and use the emoji tab due to various layers of keyboard glitching on top of one another, voice recordings stop working and sending properly once you exceed one minute of duration and the chats and channels glitch and lag which causes the app to change locations or scroll to upper parts of the chat. Absolutely horrendous and unbearable.",2,2024-09-26,0

"Swipe-to-reply is still something that cannot be disabled. It seems they're trying to mitigate the loss of muscle memory with the server list by making the search function visible at the top of each channel. Small group chats are still ridiculously obtuse to navigate to the search function and member list for. My suggestion is still to go grab version 205.15 and install it. Check review history if you want. Edit: Nice automated reply, you trogs. Good way to keep user sentiment up (sarcasm)",1,2024-09-26,0
"I've been using Discord for about 6 years and I absolutely love it. Gives me the space to connect with some of my close friends, classmates, or even an entire community of gamers. I do have one recommendation though. I would love the opportunity for Discord to have a stories/highlights feature similar to the likes of Instagram, Facebook, ans other social media. Users should be able to post stories about what's on their mind, or even if it's something as silly as sharing funny memes.",5,2024-09-26,1

Used discord mobile since 2018. This is the worst the app has ever been. Send a gif and it'll keep the gif page up so you don't know if it actually sent or not. Go to send a picture and half the screen bugs out and doesn't let you send anything until you close the app and reopen. Send a message and it keeps the message typed after sending so you have to erase your message. How this ever got past QA is beyond me. This app gets worse and worse. Bring back 2018 discord. This isn't discord anymore,1,2024-09-26,0

I've enjoyed discord for ages. But trying to log into other mobile devices is difficult when the password was made 5 years ago and the email used for it is deleted. It has an option to use a mobile number to send a code and verify it but then it sends the password reset to the email and refuses to let you log in still.

Used to work fine but lately becomes completely unresponsive within 10-20 seconds of opening app. And yes I've already connected sorry and tried all of their suggestions including uninstalling and reinstalling the app 4 or 5 times.

"Discord updates on the phone have always been a second fiddle experience cause I'm primarily on my PC.

Not only that but it's fairly unoptimized, everything is stuttering, partially freezing and taking longer to load then ever before on the phone version now.",3,2024-09-24,0

This application has gone into the toilet since the pivot to mimicing social media apps. I cant even reliably use speech to text any as the function just refuses to work with discord anymore.... Try listening to your users and not the dogwater trash you guys picked up from meta please? Edit 1: its even worse lately then before. At this point it feels like every few months management is trying to see how much worse they can make the product. I would give this zero Stars if Google would let me.,1,2024-09-23,0

"In general- I just hate the ""new"" update. I know it's not new anymore, but I liked the old layout so much better, and I've tried to adjust to the new one, but I still don't like it at all. I don't understand why it had to be changed in the first place. Other than that, my current main issue is that there's no way to change the ringtone from what I can tell, and it's always random for me. I want to be able to just have my phones ringtone, but it's always super loud and obnoxious.",2,2024-09-23,0

I'm on Android. I use this all the time but about a month ago I can't reply to comments or react to comments. I can't use the damn app anymore as it never posts my replies or comments or anything.

"This is... This is bad with the update. I have to close out and reopen the app consistently to get my chat window to show correctly, as it just stays frozen no matter what server I switch to. Sometimes I send a message and I see it went through on chat but it's also still in the text box. For functionality I don't know why they moved messages to its own thing.

"Yet another example of an amazing idea turned into coorporate slop. This app forced itself into focus while I watched a video to ask for this review. Similarly, the text box in the app has over the years been squished to miniscule sizes in order to make room for more in-app purchases, showing they care more about money than accessibility. I cannot in good faith recommend anything that disrespects its own users in these ways. If you need a way to reach your friends on your phone, this isn't it.",1,2024-09-22,0

Discord years ago on mobile was perfectly fine. But now? Its a mess. All these new updates to its UI and whatnot are really grinding my gears with how useless they are and not to mention how terribly dysfunctional the mobile stream function is now. It used to stream fine for me back in 2020 and now suddenly it kills my ingame framerate and cuts my mic off if i am not in discord? It took me awhile to adjust to its new menus and design but with this huge chop in framerate its a pain...,2,2024-09-15,0
I am very angry on discord yesterday in the morning I have gotten a message for verification and it's saying that i need to verify by email I have clicked on resend email bcoz my email is expired but i didn't get any mail from discord guys don't use discord it's a garbage app nothing else and i don't know why this happening?

I used the website mainly but recently I've had a problem with getting into my DM's and it's kinda a pain I love everything else tho but Nitro seems a little dumb to me tbh it's just a cash grab to make rich people or people who don't know how to spend their money feel like they're cool,3,2024-09-13,0

"Discord is truly an amazing app, but there are just some things that have been happening that I cannot get over. Firstly, it kicks me out of calls randomly. Similarly, it kicks me out of the screen share. Lastly, whenever I am sharing my screen, other's cannot hear what I am saying. I can hear my friends when they're screen sharing, but for some reason they can't hear me. I hope that this gets fixed eventually.",3,2024-09-13,0

Discord has allowed google to charge me thousands of dollars from other accounts from some bluestacks developer that's been charging extra things on my account they just refuse to believe it's them doing it. I just don't see how they are able to take money from my account unless I put my finger print on it but they use your own settings in beta against you.

The previous version worked fine, please fix this Update: I got an invalid bot response telling me to do quite literally what I've already done and stated smh, just shows how little you care",2,2024-09-12,0
This app is the main way for me to reach my on line friends. The only problem (which really sucks) is that the difference between file size limits between nitro and non-nitro is crazy. 10 MB for non-nitro users compared to 500 MB for nitro users (that's a whole other 490 MB) is a major difference and it really isn't fair. I like to share with my friends but I struggle to even send 1 minute videos sometimes. If you increased the size limit it'd be great. Also swear it used to be 25 MB,3,2024-09-12,0

Honestly I don't think discord is safe since it doesn't delete any chat history in private dms after 30 days of deleting your account the private dm should automatically disappear and the fact yall keep personal data from a user after deleting their account should be against users privacy and i don't think dms are private either since yall keep those chat instead deleting them because Honestly shouldn't be none yall business to keep them,1,2024-09-10,0

"After writing a message and swiping on your previous text so the message is sent as a reply, sometimes you can overswipe, which will make you edit the text you wanted to ""reply"" to, deleting your message.

"Edit 2: So... I think I figured it out. It is caused if I ever switch to the ""midnight"" theme (the darker-than-dark mode) and back to light. It is solved by wiping Discord's app data in my settings.

And then I have to restart the app repeatedly because random messages of dark text on black is extremely hard to read.",4,2024-09-07,1

This app is really good when wanting to make online friends or chat with friends you already have.

Yeah no thanks. The new ui is literally so glitchy. Sometimes I can't even view photos because only half of them appears on my screen. Typing feels so slow compared to the previous ui. No thanks. I'm downgrading.,1,2024-09-02,0

"on foldable, the app glitches the window size into the navigation button area and the top status bar when going from tablet mode to the folded phone mode. The image scaling and image view breaks too much. Also, I use the floating keyboard a lot in tablet mode.

I've had a terrible experience with this app. They advertise their premium subscription heavy on the app. They include a free trial which I accepted. I tried out their Nitro (premium) version of discord and discovered I don't need it whatsoever. I went to the settings in the app and cannot cancel the subscription. It's a difficult and time consuming process trying to cancel the subscription you need to open a new account on their support page and request a cancelation. Theft.,1,2024-08-27,0

You still just don't understand! I am on Discord most of the day. I am in 15 servers. I DO NOT need your suggestions on where to go next. MAKE THESE NONSTOP NOTIFICATIONS GO AWAY. I HAVE A BRAIN! These notifications are an insult to our intelligence! Nope to your response. It's inside each channel that you are trashing our experience. It's not notifications per se. In a server you have trash at the top and bottom of the page,1,2024-08-24,0

"Discord is a powerful tool for community engagement with its flexible text, voice, and video chat features. It offers customizable servers and integrates well with other apps. However, its extensive features can be overwhelming for newcomers, and occasional performance issues may disrupt usage.

"Update: Replying to the actual scripted and sad response I received. Hey Discord person, I'm not a child. I know how to navigate an app. You don't have it optimized. End of story. You make clicking a name default to their last response. It's not easy to long press and reply, clearly you know this... Try to reply to chat, it sends you up the chat forum instead of trying to reply. Poorly optimized for the actual user. Desktop is good but the app is very mediocre and not well optimized whatsoever.",1,2024-08-17,0

Why does this app force you to use internal storage now? I am running out of internal storage and I got an SD card and when I transfer it to the SD card it just crashes when I try to open it this is ridiculous what are you guys trying to pull? I cannot afford a new phone currently so I got an SD card and thought that would help but when I try to open it when it's transferred onto the SD card it just does not open! this is frustrating. Gonna uninstall until you fix this bogus issue.,1,2024-08-15,0

"I've been using Discord since late 2017. As of late, the mobile app has been severely neglected when it comes to rolling out bug fixes and making the app useable.

i have used this app for near 10 years at this current point. back in the day it was amazing. ran perfectly with no UI or optimization problems.. that is not at all the case now. discord mobile is officially at the lowest it's ever been and i almost can't even use the app on my phone without it glitching after 5 minutes. (mind you i never have any problems or optimization issues on PC.) this is an absolute joke and these devs should be laughing at themselves for how bad this app has gotten. L,1,2024-08-14,0

Was having a problem that shouldn't have been happening that's completely solvable on the devs end where if you have power saving mode enabled on mobile & you are pulled into a locked VC discord makes it so that nobody can hear you talk but you can hear everybody else & it's 100% the devs fault as they could have developed the mobile app so this does not ever happen as they were able to prevent it from happening in public VC's so why not in locked VC's would give 0 due to the bot used to respond,1,2024-08-09,0

"When opening a channel with more than 25 recent messages it's a 50/50 whether the app will give you a button to scroll back to the earliest unread message or simply place you right at the bottom and mark everything as read. This, along with images inexplicably being overlaid with a loading symbol moments after they've been enlarged, is just one of several extremely frustrating bugs that were added when Discord bogglingly decided to replace the original, better-functioning app several years ago",1,2024-08-08,0

"The desktop version works ok, but the mobile version doesn't. For example, gifs do not load properly in the mobile version. Also, the discord support and moderation don't work properly as they ban people without reason and do not give them a chance to appeal even tho they say they do. So overall, I would rate discord as follows: Desktop with Vencord 4.5/5, Desktop without Vencord 3/5 and mobile 1/5.",1,2024-08-08,0

"Would love to give 5 stars and here's why I'm giving 3: 1. There's still no implementation of safety regarding your connections. There has to be an option to set the visibility to friends, server members, and everyone else - as multiple choice. 2. During start up of a vc the buttons at the bottom (camera, chat, microphone etc) don't appear. You need to press each one individually for them to show. The 'home' bar at the bottom covers buttons in the app. The keyboard covers the input.",3,2024-07-31,0

Alright here's my honest review this app sucks most of the time the only reason I do keep.it is because it's the only place my friends do talk but the thing goes down so much it's almost not even worth it not only that but the people on this app are just down right toxic if you like being ghosted blocked and betrayed discord just for you (review update) okay so I took the advice given to me as help on my review now I can't even log in to discord so I'm bumping the rating down to a one star,1,2024-07-28,0

Your app is such a bloated mess now. Coming back after switching to signal for a while has shown me that. The chat bar used to just share space with the media button and the send button. Now it's sharing space with a gift nitro button and a load of other garbage. And you clearly can't decide what the best design is since you keep flipping back and forth. Once I get my last friend to move from it I'm uninstalling it and never looking back. Good riddance.,2,2024-07-28,0

"UI change is very questionable, where it is more in your face. For example, it restrict user to chat, rather than seeing everything at once, like chat, servers, and friends. There are some nice features like the activity button. However, they removed some features from the last one, like swiping right to see the friends in the server and turning it into an insta reply.

Pretty cool app and I kinda like the fact that you can actually tap and reply to that exact message that somebody sent no matter if they also sent others but can't stop you from sending a reply on a text that maybe impressed you and you don't want to confuse it with other messages that were sent after that.
