Sometimes, the keyboard wouldn't appear at all suddenly, and the only fix I found was restarting the app. Switching between servers is very slow, as well as between text channels at times. I've got real fast 100+ MBP/s connection and a beefy phone, so it makes me sad that the app just runs so slowly at times :(", 'Discord, a platform hailed for its versatile communication tools, has unfortunately become overrun with individuals I deem "gooners." These users flood channels with frivolous chatter, often devoid of meaningful discourse. The once thriving, engaging environment is now marred by incessant noise, detracting from the apps true potential. While Discord remains a valuable tool for real-time interaction, its user base has, in many cases, devolved into a cacophony of juvenile distractions.', 'loving it', 'very good app for playing games definitely install it', 'I GOT MY MONEY DEDUCTED FOR THE NITRO THAT I DID NOT EVEN PAY FOR!!', "Forums don't open anymore, pressing on servers in the emoji list doesn't do anything, but at least I can forward messages amirite", "Im trying to recover my account through phone number but I'm receiving nothing even it's says a code has already been sent, pls fix this soon.", "this is really great for texting and calling well I guess is really hard to sign in and log in like I have an acc and it doesn't let me in Is really hard but this is cool", "I finally can be accepted for my likes and dislikes. I have very... diverse hyperfixtations, and haven't known anyone in person who actually likes what I like. But discord helped me find my people and now I've made a long time friend, we've traded numbers and I finally have someone to talk to about my interest. 5/5 stars", "there is a problem on it on reopening the app discord is not the same anymore because the date of birth doesn't even load so fast I have tried countless times over and over it wouldn't let me register on an account", 'Masti per \U0001f970\U0001f970\U0001f60d\U0001f60d', "First it was Slow now it doesn't even work with my Wi-Fi but will work with mobile data", 'Every update ruins this app more and more.

Only problem is I wish I could use custom emojis but you gatta pay for that AND larger file sizes I wish I could send gifs or videos (edit, it used to be 4 stars but now it's 1 because they keep reducing the max file size, 10mb's is not enough minimum file size to send a video, this is harassment)", 'Duuuuhhhhh.....user no need audio!
